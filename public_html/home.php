		<p>We are a small breed kennel located in Craig, Colorado.</p>
		<p>We have one to two litters a year.  All puppies are evaluated for structure and temperament at about 8 weeks old. We breed our litters to produce show quality dogs. Since Shelties are size restricted for conformation and will change so much during adolescence, we often choose to keep them for four to six months prior to placing them as pets.</p>
		<p>All our puppies will be well socialized the same as our Show prospects. Our goal is to produce sound structure, great temperament and healthy champions. Occasionally we have show prospects available to show homes and performance dogs for the performance enthusiast, as well as beautiful bright companions.</p>
		<p>All our pet puppies are sold on a spay/neuter contract. Check our Nursery for current and planned litters and a puppy application.</p>

		<p>We join many other Sheltie breeders in the importance of health and testing of our dogs.  Health and temperament rank among our highest concerns when breeding Shelties.  Choosing a sire and dam carefully has led to making the shy Sheltie almost a characteristic of the past.  All Aspenleaf adult Shelties are tested for hips OFA, vWD, Thyroid  and Eye certification.</p>
		<p>The Shetland Sheepdog is intensely loyal, affectionate, and responsive to his owner.</p>		 
		<p>Right Breed for You?</p>
		<p>Shelties love their families, but may be reserved at first with strangers. As a herding dog, they love to run and play with a built in herding instinct. Being a very vocal breed they may bark if untrained. Shelties thrive on the farm, but adapt to many living situations if given proper exercise and attention. The breed's dense double coat requires regular maintenance.(Weekly to Bi-weekly brushing)</p>
