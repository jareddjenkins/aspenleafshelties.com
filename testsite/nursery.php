	<p>If you are interested in obtaining a puppy from the <a href="http://www.aspenleafshelties.com/available.php" >available</a> page, please fill out the <a href="/files/AspenLeafQuestionnaire.doc" > Aspen Leaf Questionnaire </a>
	and send it to me in an email at <a href="mailto:kellydavidson@bresnan.net">kellydavidson@bresnan.net</a></p>

	<p>All our breeding stock are tested for vWD,
	Hip Dysplasia, Thyroid, and Eyes.
	All dogs are sold with a health guarantee.</p>

	<p>Our prices are as follows:</p>

	<p>Companion puppies are $900 which includes the AKC registration fee.  Registration papers will be sent upon proof of spay/neuter of companion puppies.</p> 
<p>One of the requirements of an AKC Breeder of Merit is to ensure that ALL puppies from a litter are registered with AKC. Therefore, part of our purchase process is to fill out the registration paperwork and mail it to AKC. Please have your puppy's registered name selected when you come to pick him/her up. (All our puppies' registered names begin with our kennel name - "Aspenleaf's.")</p> 
<p>Show prospects are $1000 now and another $600 (on co-ownership) when they take their first AKC/CKC point, finish a UKC championship or are bred... OR $1500 outright (no co-ownership) & no future payments.</p>
