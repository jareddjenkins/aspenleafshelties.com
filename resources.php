<p>Pet nutrition is fast becoming a great concern for many pet owners.  At Aspenleaf Shelties, we put the health of our dogs at the #1 priority.  When we researched the many foods on the market today, we found that only the Life’s Abundance offered the quality and freshness that we were looking for.</p>
<p>Life’s Abundance was created to provide companion animals with a nutritional advantage, Life’s Abundance Premium Health Food for Puppies & Adult Dogs is made with select ingredients to help your dog achieve and maintain optimum health.</p>
<p>Formulated by Dr. Jane Bicks, one of the nation’s leading holistic veterinarians, this superior food addresses the needs of the whole body.  Every ingredient is carefully chosen based upon its positive effects on a dog’s physiology, to promote the long-term health of canines.</p>
<p>Loved by both puppies and adult dogs of all breeds and sizes, this delicious recipe features an antioxidant system to support dogs throughout their life cycle. Also figuring prominently are omega fatty acids to promote healthy skin and a glossy coat, and complex carbohydrates from oat groats for sustained energy.  Another highlight of this food is our proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals to supply dogs with the nutrients that help them to thrive, regardless of their age.  This Life’s Abundance recipe furnishes the body with optimal protein levels, to help puppies grow strong and adults to maintain muscle mass.  Additionally, we have added a balanced blend of calcium and phosphorous to support both developing and aging bones.  Our naturally-flavored kibble comes complete with dietary fiber to promote digestive health.</p>

		<p>And because we use only wholesome ingredients, this formula contains no artificial colors or flavors, no corn, no wheat and no glutens.  Life’s Abundance is nutritionally-dense, which means that you won’t have to feed your dog as much food as other brands. That can translate into savings you can count on, meal after meal, year after year. Not only that, but smaller meals and concentrated nutrition means less mess to clean up outside.</p>
		<p>When you try Life’s Abundance, you’ll know why people say it’s what a pet food should be!</p>
