      <p>I dreamed of owning shelties since I was young. I knew the commitment would take a lot of time so I decided to
        raise a family before starting my endevour. When my youngest child took an interest in dogs through the 4-H
        program when set out to adopt our first sheltie.</p>

      <p>We started out the same way we all start out in dogs; finding
        the one dog (or more appropriately, the one finding us) that simply change our heart and soul forever. We found
        our
        first sheltie DJ, although he was not a comfirmation dog, He and Mitchell created a bond that was instant
        and ran incredibly deep, and they went on and competed in obedience and rally and won several titles in the 4-H
        program. During our time in 4-H, we were introduced to confirmation shows and
        the rest, as they say, was history...
      </p>
      <p>At Aspenleaf Shelties, we strive to produce puppies with a melting expression and wonderfully
        sweet personalities that
        the Sheltie is known for. We have devoted our life to raising and showing these wonderful dogs, but do not take
        that lightly. I, Kelly, constantly research pedigrees, studying temperaments, and and stay up to date with the
        latest health
        tests to ensure each new generation is an improvement over the last.
      </p>
      <p> We are very thankful for both the dogs, and the people we have met along our journey. We have developed many
        friendships with my puppy buyers, and love seeing both them and their dogs when they come to visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We join many other Sheltie breeders in the importance of health and testing of our dogs. Health and
        temperament rank among our highest concerns when breeding Shelties. The shy Shelties is now a characteristic of
        the past, because we carefully choose the Sire and Dam with the characteristics that we strive to have in our
        home.
