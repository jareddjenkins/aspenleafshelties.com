                We breed several well thought out litters each year, and have waiting lists for both show
                and companion puppies.  Our puppies are home raised and vet checked before leaving. 
            </p>
            <p> Our companion puppies are ready to go around eight to ten weeks of age.  Our show puppies
                usually stay a while longer.  We carefully screen prospective buyers, as we are looking to
                place our puppies in the best possible homes, with the understanding that the puppy is a
                lifetime commitment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We guarantee our puppies to be in good health at the time of sale and provide a two-year
                temperament and genetic health guarantee. 
                We are members in good standing of
                the following clubs:
