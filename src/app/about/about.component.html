            <p>We are a small breed kennel located in Craig, CO</p>
            <p>We have one to two litters a year. All puppies are evaluated for structure and temperament at about 8 weeks
              old.
              We breed our litters to produce show quality dogs. Since Shelties are size restricted for conformation and
              will

              change
              so much during adolescence, we often choose to keep them for four to six months prior to placing them as pets.
              All our puppies will be well socialized the same as our Show prospects. Our goal is to produce sound
              structure,
              great temperament and healthy champions. Occasionally we have show prospects available to show homes and
              performance
              dogs for the performance enthusiast, as well as beautiful bright companions.
              All our pet puppies are sold on a spay/neuter contract. Check our Nursery for current and planned litters and
              a
              puppy application.
              We join many other Sheltie breeders in the importance of health and testing of our dogs. Health and
              temperament

              rank among our highest concerns when breeding Shelties. Choosing a sire and dam carefully has led to making
              the
              shy
              Sheltie almost a characteristic of the past. All Aspenleaf adult Shelties are tested for hips OFA, vWD,
              Thyroid
              and
              Eye certification.</p>
            <p>The Shetland Sheepdog is intensely loyal, affectionate, and responsive to his owner.</p>
            <p>Right Breed for You?</p>
            <p>Shelties love their families, but may be reserved at first with strangers. As a herding dog, they love to run
              and
              play with a built in herding instinct. Being a very vocal breed they may bark if untrained. Shelties thrive on
              the
              farm, but adapt to many living situations if given proper exercise and attention. The breed's dense double
              coat
              requires
              regular maintenance.(Weekly to Bi-weekly brushing)</p>
            <p>
              We breed several well thought out litters each year, and have waiting lists for both show
              and companion puppies.  Our puppies are home raised and vet checked before leaving. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Our companion puppies are ready to go around eight to ten weeks of age.  Our show puppies
              usually stay a while longer.  We carefully screen prospective buyers, as we are looking to
              place our puppies in the best possible homes, with the understanding that the puppy is a
              lifetime commitment. 
              We guarantee our puppies to be in good health at the time of sale and provide a two-year
              temperament and genetic health guarantee. 
              We are members in good standing of
              the following clubs:
