        Aspenleaf Shelties was founded in 2008. We started our journey on a small farm in Northwest Colorado.
        Since that time, we have bred or owned several Champions, with Best of Breed winners,
        and Multi Herding Group placements and Specialty winners,
        and most importantly lovable family companions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021 we moved to Northeast Georgia were we continue to breed and raise our beloved companions.

        I work at home, as such all the dogs spend their time running and playing outdoors as well as lounging on the
        couch and relaxing amongst the family.
