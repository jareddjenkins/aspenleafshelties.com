    Aspenleaf Shelties was founded in 2008. We started our journey on a small
    farm in Northwest Colorado.

      Since that time, we have bred or owned several
      Champions, with Best of Breed winners, and Multi Herding Group placements
      and Specialty winners, and most importantly lovable family companions.
      In 2021 we moved to Northeast Georgia were we continue to breed and raise
      our beloved companions.

      I work at home, as such all the dogs spend their time running and playing
      outdoors as well as lounging on the couch and relaxing amongst the family.

      The Shetland Sheepdog is intensely loyal, affectionate, and responsive
      to his owner. At Aspenleaf Shelties we strive to produce puppies with
      the melting expression and wonderfully sweet personalities that the
      Sheltie is known for. We have devoted our life to raising and showing
      these wonderful dogs, but do not take that lightly. I research
      pedigrees, study temperaments, and stay up to date with the latest
      health tests to ensure each new generation is an improvement over the
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many other Sheltie breeders, we believe in the importance of health
      and testing of our dogs. Health and temperament rank among our highest
      concerns when breeding Shelties. The shy Sheltie is now a characteristic
      of the past, because we carefully choose the Sire and Dam with the
      characteristics that we strive to have in our home. All Aspenleaf adult
      Shelties are tested for hips OFA, vWD, Thyroid, DMS and Eye
      certification.
    </p>
    <p>We are members in good standing of the following clubs:</p>
    <p>
      Cenntennial Shetland Sheepdog Club
      <br />
      American Shetland Sheepdog Association
      <br />
      We are also Breeders of Merit with American Kennel Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are very thankful for both the dogs and the people we have met along
      our journey. We have developed many friendships with our puppy buyers
      and love seeing both them and their dogs when they come to visit.
