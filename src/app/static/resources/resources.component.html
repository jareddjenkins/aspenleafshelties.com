        When you try Life’s Abundance, you’ll know why people say it’s what a
        pet food should be!
      </p>
      <p>
        And because we use only wholesome ingredients, this formula contains no
        artificial colors or flavors, no corn, no wheat and no glutens. Life’s
        Abundance is nutritionally-dense, which means that you won’t have to
        feed your dog as much food as other brands. That can translate into
        savings you can count on, meal after meal, year after year. Not only
        that, but smaller meals and concentrated nutrition means less mess to
        clean up outside.
