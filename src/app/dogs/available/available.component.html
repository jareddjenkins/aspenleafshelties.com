                At Aspenleaf Shelties, we breed to produce show quality dogs. Each litter is carefully planned to
                ensure
                sound structure, great temperament, and healthy champions.

                Our puppies are socialized as if they are show prospects. They are home-raised, up to date on age
                appropriate vaccines and vet-checked prior to leaving. 
                We guarantee our puppies to be in
                good health at the time of sale and provide a two-year
                temperament and genetic health guarantee.

                    Our companion puppies are ready to go around eight to ten weeks of age.  Our show puppies
                    usually stay a while longer. Shelties are size restricted for the show
                    ring and can change a lot during adolescence. As such, we
                    may keep them for four to six months
                    prior to placing them as pets.

                    We have waiting lists for both show
                    and companion puppies.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    We carefully screen prospective buyers, as we are looking to place our puppies in the best possible
                    homes, with the understanding that the puppy is a lifetime commitment. 
                    We reserve the right to refuse a sale.

                <h5>Right breed for You?</h5>
                <p>Shelties love their families, but may be reserved at first with strangers. As a herding dog, they
                    love to
                    run and play with a built in herding instinct. Being a very vocal breed they may bark if untrained.
                    Shelties
                    thrive
                    on the farm, but adapt to many living situations if given proper exercise and attention. The breed's
                    dense
                    double
                    coat requires regular maintenance. (Weekly to Bi-weekly brushing)
                </p>
